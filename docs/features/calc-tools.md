Based on my analysis of your Calc tool-calling API implementation in `core/calc_tools.py`, `core/calc_bridge.py`, `core/calc_manipulator.py`, `core/calc_inspector.py`, `core/calc_sheet_analyzer.py`, `core/calc_error_detector.py`, and related files, I'll summarize what's currently implemented and suggest targeted improvements to make it better, more robust, and more capable.

### Current Strengths
- **Comprehensive coverage**: You have a solid foundation covering most common Calc operations (reading, writing, formatting,_sheet management, charts, error detection, sorting, clearing).
- **Modular architecture**: Clean separation of concerns (`Bridge` for low-level UNO, `Inspector` for reading, `Manipulator` for writing, `Analyzer` for structure, `Detector` for errors).
- **Context-aware system prompt**: The `DEFAULT_CALC_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `core/constants.py` effectively guides the AI to use tools properly, reminds about semicolon syntax, and structures workflow (understand → read → use tools → confirm).
- **Performance optimizations**: Persistent HTTP connections, global shared instances for tools (avoiding recreation per call), and batch-friendly logic in many places.
- **Error handling**: `format_error_for_display` for user-friendly messages, detailed error explanations in `ErrorDetector`, and exception catching throughout.
- **Calc-specific context**: `get_calc_context_for_chat` provides basic sheet summary (name, range, headers, selection), which is a good start for relevant context without overwhelming tokens.

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. **Enhanced Tool Coverage and Capabilities**
Your current 11 tools cover the essentials, but expanding to more advanced operations would make the AI more powerful. Prioritized additions:

- **Data Analysis Tools**:
  - `add_auto_filter(range_str, has_header=True)`: Enable/disable filters on ranges (building on your existing `set_auto_filter` logic in `CellManipulator`).
  - `start_data_pivot(range_str, target_cell)`: Create pivot tables with drag-and-drop configuration (target_cell for where to place the pivot).
  - `apply_conditional_formatting(range_str, rule_type, condition, style)`: Add color scales, icon sets, or data bars (e.g., rule_type="color_scale", condition="values_above_threshold", style={"min_color": "#FFA500"}).

- **Advanced Manipulation**:
  - `insert_columns(position, count=1)` and `insert_rows(position, count=1)`: Already in `CellManipulator`, but add to `CALC_TOOLS` schema for AI access.
  - `delete_columns(col_letter, count=1)` and `delete_rows(row_num, count=1)`: Also already implemented—expose them.
  - `set_column_width(col, width_mm)` and `set_row_height(row, height_mm)`: In `CellManipulator` but not exposed.
  - `auto_fit_columns(range_str)`: Analogous to existing `auto_fit_column`, but ranged.
  - `copy_paste_range(source_range, target_cell, operation="copy"|"cut")`: Extend copy_range for cut/paste.
  - `import_csv(file_path, delimiter, target_cell)` and `export_csv(range_str, file_path)`: For data import/export.

- **Validation and Advanced Formatting**:
  - `add_data_validation(range_str, type, condition)`: E.g., "list", "whole_number", "date" with min/max/conditions.
  - `group_rows(range_str)` / `ungroup_rows`: For outlining collapsible groups.
  - `freeze_panes(row, col)`: Freeze/split panes at specific row/column.

- **Statistical/Business Analysis**:
  - `calculate_statistics(range_str)`: Mean, median, std dev, quartiles, etc., above your column-level `column_statistics`.
  - `create_custom_chart(type, data, labels, axes_customization)`: Extend your `create_chart` with more options (e.g., multi-axis, stacked).

**Implementation Notes**: Most of these build directly on your existing `CellManipulator` and `CalcBridge` classes. For new complex features like pivots/charts, leverage LibreOffice's API (e.g., `DatabaseRange` for filters/pivots, `XChartDocument` for advanced charting). Expose them in `CALC_TOOLS` with clear schemas (e.g., enum-validation for types).

#### 2. **Tool Usability and AI Guidance Improvements**
- **Smarter Parameters and Defaults**:
  - For tools like `sort_range`, add optional `orientation="rows"` (default) or `"columns"` (sort by rows).
  - For `create_chart`, enhance to support primary/secondary axes and custom colors.
  - Add response details: After `write_formula`, include the computed result (e.g., "Total: 123.45" if it's a formula).

- **Composited/Batch Tools**: Reduce tool-call chain length for common workflows.
  - `create_table(range_str, headers_list, has_borders=True)`: Combine `write_formula` for headers, `set_cell_style` for borders, `merge_cells` for multi-column headers.
  - `format_range(range_str, preset="header"|"data"|"total")`: Apply predefined style combos (e.g., header=bold+centered, total=bold+border).

- **Better Error Recovery**:
  - Tools should validate inputs (e.g., check if range exists before operations) and provide actionable feedback.
  - Add `undo_last_tool()` or `revert_range(range_str)` using LibreOffice's undo API (model's `XUndoManager`).

#### 3. **Enhanced Context and Memory for Better AI Performance**
- **Richer Document Context** (`get_calc_context_for_chat`):
  - Include a small preview of data (first 5-10 rows of used range) for AI understanding—analogous to Writer's excerpts.
  - Add sheet-level summary: % of empty cells, data types (numeric/text/formula ratios), last modified regions.
  - Track "working memory": In the chat panel, cache last 3 operations (e.g., "Wrote formulas in A1:A5") and include in context.

- **Tool History Integration**: The AI forgets intermediate steps; enhance prompts to remind the AI of multi-step plans (e.g., "Don't forget to merge headers after writing them.").

#### 4. **Robustness and Error Handling**
- **Validation Layer**: Before executing tools, validate ranges (e.g., via `SheetAnalyzer.detect_data_regions()` to ensure the range is coherent).
- **Unsafe Operations**: For destructive tools like `clear_range`, require confirmation (add `confirm=True` parameter, defaulting to True for safety).
- **Fallbacks**: If a visual operation fails (e.g., chart creation due to no data), explain why and suggest alternatives instead of just throwing.
- **Cross-Session State**: Your global `_get_tools` instances are good, but add loading/saving of sheet state for resumed sessions.

#### 5. **Performance and Scaling**
- **Lazy Reading**: For large ranges, `read_cell_range` should page results or sample (e.g., max 1000 cells; warn if truncated).
- **Bulk Operations**: Instead of single `write_formula` calls in loops, add `write_formula_batch(cell_values_dict)` for writing multiple cells in one go.
- **Caching**: Cache sheet summaries and headers for 30s to avoid redundant UNO calls in rapid tool chains.

#### 6. **Integration with LibreOffice Ecosystem**
- **Sheet-Level Locking**: For multi-user scenarios (rare in Calc), use `XSheetOperation.lockRange()` during tool execution.
- **Extension Compatibility**: Test with Calc add-ins (e.g., ensure your tools work alongside statistical extensions).
- **Localization**: Your error messages assume English; make them locale-aware if expanding.

### Implementation Plan and Next Steps
1. **Prioritize and Prototype**: Start with easy wins like exposing `insert_rows/columns` and `set_column_width` (already coded). Then pivot tables, as they're common requests.
2. **Update `CALC_TOOLS` Schema**: Ensure new tools have detailed descriptions and examples in schemas for better AI usage.
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Use your existing `calc_tests.py` and add scenarios for edge cases (merged cells, weird ranges).
4. **System Prompt Refinement**: Update `DEFAULT_CALC_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` to include instructions for new tools (e.g., "Use insert_rows/delete_columns for structure changes.").
5. **Metrics and Logging**: Add `agent_log` calls in new tools for debugging (e.g., log successful range operations with sizes).


#### Bulk Operations and CSV Import (Completed)

**Goal**: Address inefficiencies in handling large datasets and multi-cell formatting. Reduces AI tool-call overhead for common tasks.

**Completed/Fixed**:
- Fixed `set_cell_style` to properly handle range formatting (single method now detects ranges and delegates to `set_range_style`). No more one-by-one AI calls for ranges.
- Range number formats now apply to entire range (new `set_range_number_format` method).
- Exposed `delete_rows`, `delete_columns` (backend methods existed; now full tools). Insert tools removed as CSV import provides better bulk data insertion.
- Added `write_formula_range` tool: Efficiently writes formulas or values to ranges. Accepts single value for entire range or array for individual cells.
- Added `import_csv_from_string` tool: Parses CSV string (e.g., "Name,Age\nAlice,30\nBob,25") and bulk-inserts into sheet starting at a cell. No file I/O required—ideal for AI-generated or pasted data.
- The method handles text/number detection automatically, supports custom delimiters (',', ';', etc.), and provides error handling for malformed CSV.
- Updated `DEFAULT_CALC_CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` to reference new tools: "Use `write_formula_range` for bulk writes, `import_csv_from_string` for bulk data inserts. `set_cell_style` works on ranges (e.g. 'A1:D10') for efficient formatting."

**Next Steps** (Future Enhancements):
- Add `write_formula_batch` for bulk cell writes (dict of cell->value) to avoid loops.
- Enhance `read_cell_range` with paging (e.g., `max_cells: int` parameter, warn if truncated) for large ranges.












Overall, your implementation is already quite capable—users can perform table creation, calculations, formatting, and charts. These enhancements would elevate it to handle complex data analysis and formatting tasks, making the AI assistant more proactive and less error-prone.
