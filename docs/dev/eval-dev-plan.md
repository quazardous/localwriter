# LocalWriter: Evaluation System Development Plan (Internal Edition)

This plan moves from an external runner to an **internal, integrated approach**—much like the existing [core/calc_tests.py](file:///home/keithcu/Desktop/Python/localwriter/core/calc_tests.py). This ensures perfect UNO compatibility and ease of use.

## 1. Goal: Integrated Eval Dashboard [COMPLETED] 🚀
Built an internal dashboard that allows the user to select models/endpoints and run the benchmark suite directly inside a Writer or Calc session.

---

## 2. Technical Components [IMPLEMENTED]

### A. Eval Dialog (`LocalWriterDialogs/EvalDialog.xdl`)
- **Endpoint URL**: TextField (populated from `localwriter.json`).
- **Model List**: ComboBox populated from endpoint-specific LRU history.
- **Run Button**: Triggers the evaluation loop.
- **Log Area**: Large TextField showing real-time "OK/FAIL" results and latencies.

### B. Eval Runner (`core/eval_runner.py`)
- **Logic**:
  - swaps model in memory per run.
  - **Programmatic Verification**: Simple doc checks.
  - **LLM-as-a-Judge**: Semantic checks for complex tasks using a judge turn.
  - **IpD Tracking**: Intelligence-per-Dollar estimation based on token usage.

## 3. Status & Accomplishments (Feb 2026)

- [x] **Core Infrastructure**: `EvalRunner` class with tool execution and verification logic.
- [x] **UI/UX**: `EvalDialog.xdl` designed and wired into the application menu (`localwriter > Evaluation Dashboard`).
- [x] **Initial Suite**: Base tests for Writer (replace, style, summarize), Calc (entry, formula, sort), and Draw (shape creation).
- [x] **Smart Judging**: Integrated "LLM-as-a-Judge" for semantic pass/fail verification.
- [x] **Detailed Plan**: Created `EVALUATION_PLAN_DETAILED.md` with 50+ scenario archetypes.

## 4. Phase 2: Roadmap & Next Steps

### A. Expand Test Suite (High Priority)
- Port the full 50+ test cases from `EVALUATION_PLAN_DETAILED.md` into `run_benchmark_suite`.
- Categorize by level (Essentials, Advanced, Expert).

### B. Multimodal Evaluation
- Implement vision-based tests (e.g., "Describe this image in the document").
- Measure "Visual Reasoning Access" latencies.

### C. Test Fixtures (Incomplete)
- Create a `tests/fixtures/` library with standardized documents:
  - `long_summarization.odt`: For testing extraction and semantic compression.
  - `complex_calc.ods`: For testing multi-sheet logic and charting.
  - `multimodal_vision.odt`: For testing image-to-text and spatial reasoning.

### D. Advanced Reporting
- Auto-generate a formatted "Benchmark Report" sheet in Calc after a run.
- Include charts for IpD comparisons (Intelligence vs. Cost).

### D. Multi-Model Sweep
- Add a "Sweep All History" mode to automatically benchmark every model in the LRU.
