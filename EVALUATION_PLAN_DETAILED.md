### Level 2: Complex Analysis (Advanced)
6.  **Data Sorting**: "Sort A1:D100 by 'Revenue' descending, after detecting the column." -> Detection + Action.
7.  **Error Debugging**: "The formula in D10 is failing. Find out why and fix it." -> Trace and fix.
8.  **Named Ranges**: "Create a named range 'SalesData' for A2:Z200." -> Metadata management.
9.  **Validation**: "Restrict Column F to only allow dates between 2020 and 2025." -> Input validation setup.
10. **Data Transpose**: "Take the row headers from A1:E1 and turn them into column headers in A1:A5." -> Structural shift.
11. **Pivot Setup**: "Create a pivot table summary of this data onto a new sheet." -> Complex object creation.

### Level 3: Visualization & Experts (Expert)
12. **Auto-Charting**: "Create a line chart for the trends in A1:B12." -> Chart creation.
13. **Data Recovery**: "Fix the broken CSV import that shifted everything by one column." -> Data shifting logic.
14. **Consolidation**: "Sum all Column B values from Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3 into Sheet4." -> Multi-sheet sum.
15. **Conditional Chains**: "If Column A is 'Profit', set Column B to 'Green'; if 'Loss', set to 'Red'." -> Logic mapping.
16. **Trend Analysis**: "Look at the last 6 months of data and predict the 7th month using a formula." -> Statistical reasoning.
17. **Chart Styling**: "Change the theme of the existing chart to 'Dark' and add a title 'Revenue 2026'." -> Object manipulation.
18. **Sensitivity Analysis**: "Increase all 'Cost' values by 10% and record the change in 'Total Profit'." -> Scenario testing.
19. **Sheet Protect**: "Lock all cells with formulas so they cannot be edited." -> Security/metadata tool.
20. **Audit Log**: "Create a log entries sheet tracking every time 'Net Profit' falls below 0." -> Logic + Log creation.
