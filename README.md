## Features

This extension provides two powerful commands for LibreOffice Writer:

### Extend Selection

**Hotkey:** `CTRL + q`

*   This uses a language model to predict what comes after the selected text. There are a lot of ways to use this.
*   Some example use cases for this include: writing a story or an email given a particular prompt, adding additional possible items to a grocery list, or summarizing the selected text.

### Edit Selection

**Hotkey:** `CTRL + e`

*   A dialog box appears to prompt the user for instructions about how to edit the selected text, then the selected text is replaced by the edited text.
*   Some examples for use cases for this include changing the tone of an email, translating text to a different language, and semantically editing a scene in a story.

### Calc PROMPT function

**=PROMPT(message, [system_prompt], [model], [max_tokens])**

## Setup

### LibreOffice Extension Installation

1.  Download the latest version of Localwriter via the [releases page](https://github.com/balisujohn/localwriter/releases).
2.  Open LibreOffice.
3.  Navigate to `Tools > Extensions`.
4.  Click `Add` and select the downloaded `.oxt` file.
5.  Follow the on-screen instructions to install the extension.

### Backend Setup

To use Localwriter, you need a backend model runner.  Options include `text-generation-webui` and `Ollama`. Choose the backend that best suits your needs. Ollama is generally easier to set up. In either of these options, you will have to download and set a model. 

#### text-generation-webui

*   Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui).
*   Docker image available [here](https://github.com/Atinoda/text-generation-webui-docker).

After installation and model setup:

1.  Enable the local OpenAI API (this ensures the API responds in a format similar to OpenAI).
2.  Verify that the intended model is working (e.g., openchat3.5, suitable for 8GB VRAM setups).
3.  Set the endpoint in Localwriter to `localhost:5000` (or the configured port).

#### Ollama

*   Installation instructions are available [here](https://ollama.com/).
*   Download and use a model (gemma3 isn't bad)
*   Ensure the API is enabled.
*   Set the endpoint in Localwriter to `localhost:11434` (or the configured port).
*   Manually set the model name. ([This is required for Ollama to work](https://ask.libreoffice.org/t/localwriter-0-0-5-installation-and-usage/122241/5?u=jbalis))

## Settings

### Configuration Priority

LocalWriter loads configuration in the following order (highest priority first):

1. **Environment Variables** (prefixed with `LOCALWRITER_`) - useful for keeping secrets out of files
2. **Configuration File** (`localwriter.json`)
3. **Default Values**

Example using environment variables:
```bash
export LOCALWRITER_API_KEY="sk-your-secret-key"
export LOCALWRITER_ENDPOINT="https://api.openai.com"
/Applications/LibreOffice.app/Contents/MacOS/soffice --writer
```

### Configuration Files

See [CONFIG_EXAMPLES.md](CONFIG_EXAMPLES.md) for ready-to-use configuration examples.

Configuration file location:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/LibreOffice/4/user/localwriter.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/libreoffice/4/user/localwriter.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\LibreOffice\4\user\localwriter.json`

### Available Settings

In the settings dialog, you can configure:

*   **Endpoint URL**: The URL of your LLM server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for OpenWebUI, `https://api.openai.com` for OpenAI)
*   **Model**: The model name (e.g., `llama2`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
*   **API Key**: Authentication key for OpenAI-compatible endpoints (optional for local servers)
*   **API Type**: `chat` or `completions` (see explanation below ⭐)
*   **Is OpenWebUI endpoint?**: Check this if using OpenWebUI (changes API path from `/v1/` to `/api/`)
*   **OpenAI Compatible Endpoint?**: Check this for servers that strictly follow OpenAI format
*   **Extend Selection Max Tokens**: Maximum number of tokens for text extension
*   **Extend Selection System Prompt**: Instructions prepended to guide the model's style for extension
*   **Edit Selection Max New Tokens**: Additional tokens allowed above original selection length
*   **Edit Selection System Prompt**: Instructions for guiding text editing behavior

### ⭐ Understanding API Type (chat vs completions)

The **API Type** setting determines the format of requests sent to your LLM server:

#### `chat` (Recommended - Modern Format)
Uses structured messages with roles:
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
  ]
}
```
**Use `chat` for:**
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo)
- OpenWebUI
- Ollama with `/api/chat` endpoint
- Most modern LLM APIs

#### `completions` (Legacy Format)
Uses a simple text prompt:
```json
{
  "prompt": "SYSTEM: You are a helpful assistant\nUSER: Hello"
}
```
**Use `completions` for:**
- Older OpenAI models (GPT-3 base)
- Simple local inference servers
- Some LM Studio configurations

**Simple rule:** If your server has a `/chat/completions` endpoint, use `chat`. Otherwise use `completions`.

Help with development is always welcome. localwriter has a number of outstanding feature requests by users. Feel free to work on any of them, and you can help improve freedom-respecting local AI.

### Local Development Setup

For developers who want to modify or contribute to Localwriter, you can run and test the extension directly from your source code without packaging it into an `.oxt` file. This allows for quick iteration and seeing changes reflected in the LibreOffice UI.

1. **Clone the Repository (if not already done):**
   - Clone the Localwriter repository to your local machine if you haven't already:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/balisujohn/localwriter.git
     cd localwriter
     ```

2. **Register the Extension Temporarily:**
   - Use the `unopkg` tool to register the extension directly from your repository folder. This avoids the need to package the extension as an `.oxt` file during development.
   - Run the following command, replacing `/path/to/localwriter/` with the path to your cloned repository:
     ```
     unopkg add /path/to/localwriter/
     ```
   - On Linux, `unopkg` is often located at `/usr/lib/libreoffice/program/unopkg`. Adjust the command if needed:
     ```
     /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/unopkg add /path/to/localwriter/
     ```

3. **Restart LibreOffice:**
   - Close and reopen LibreOffice Writer or Calc. You should see the "localwriter" menu with options like "Extend Selection", "Edit Selection", and "Settings" in the menu bar.

4. **Make and Test Changes:**
   - Edit the source files (e.g., `main.py`) directly in your repository folder using your preferred editor.
   - After making changes, restart LibreOffice to reload the updated code. Test the functionality and UI elements (dialogs, menu actions) directly in LibreOffice.
   - Note: Restarting is often necessary for Python script changes to take effect, as LibreOffice caches modules.

5. **Commit Changes to Git:**
   - Since you're working directly in your Git repository, commit your changes as needed:
     ```
     git add main.py
     git commit -m "Updated extension logic for ExtendSelection"
     ```

6. **Unregister the Extension (Optional):**
   - If you need to remove the temporary registration, use:
     ```
     unopkg remove org.extension.localwriter
     ```
   - Replace `org.extension.localwriter` with the identifier from `description.xml` if different.

### Building the Extension Package

To generate the custom function UNO interface rdb from interface definition idl:

```
"c:\Program Files\LibreOffice\sdk\bin\unoidl-write.exe" "c:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program\types.rdb" "c:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program\types\offapi.rdb" idl\XPromptFunction.idl XPromptFunction.rdb
```

To create a distributable `.oxt` package:

In a terminal, change directory into the localwriter repository top-level directory, then run the following command:

````
zip -r localwriter.oxt \
  Accelerators.xcu \
  Addons.xcu \
  CalcAddIn.xcu \
  XPromptFunction.rdb \
  assets \
  description.xml \
  main.py \
  prompt_function.py \
  META-INF \
  registration \
  README.md
````

This will create the file `localwriter.oxt` which you can open with libreoffice to install the localwriter extension. You can also change the file extension to .zip and manually unzip the extension file, if you want to inspect a localwriter `.oxt` file yourself. It is all human-readable, since python is an interpreted language.
