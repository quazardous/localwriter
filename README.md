# LocalWriter

> **WIP (refactor)** — The `framework` branch is an ongoing architectural refactor. Expect breaking changes.

A LibreOffice extension that adds AI capabilities to Writer, Calc, and Draw — local-first, modular, and extensible.

## Features

- **Chat Sidebar** — multi-turn AI chat with tool-calling to read and edit your document
- **MCP Server** — expose tools to external AI clients (Cursor, Claude Desktop, scripts) via HTTP
- **Calc `=PROMPT()`** — call an LLM directly from a spreadsheet cell
- **Image Generation** — generate and edit images from chat (AI Horde, local backends)
- **Edit/Extend Selection** — hotkeys to rewrite or continue selected text (`Ctrl+E` / `Ctrl+Q`)
- **Tunnels** — expose MCP externally via ngrok, Cloudflare, bore, or Tailscale

## Backends

Any OpenAI-compatible API: Ollama, LM Studio, OpenRouter, OpenAI, text-generation-webui, etc.

## Install

1. Download the latest `.oxt` from the [releases page](https://github.com/quazardous/localwriter/releases)
2. In LibreOffice: **Tools > Extension Manager > Add**
3. Restart LibreOffice
4. Configure your endpoint in **LocalWriter > Settings**

## Architecture

LocalWriter uses a modular framework where each feature is a self-contained module with its own config, services, and tools. See [DEVEL.md](DEVEL.md) for the full developer guide.

### Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `core` | Document access, config, events, LLM, image, formatting |
| `writer` | Writer document editing tools (content, comments, styles, tables, tracking) |
| `writer.nav` | Heading tree, bookmarks, proximity navigation |
| `writer.index` | Full-text search with Snowball stemming |
| `calc` | Spreadsheet tools (cells, sheets, formulas, charts) |
| `draw` | Draw/Impress tools (shapes, pages/slides) |
| `common` | Cross-document tools (info, export) |
| `batch` | Multi-tool execution with variable chaining |
| `chatbot` | AI chat sidebar |
| `ai_openai` | OpenAI-compatible LLM backend |
| `ai_ollama` | Ollama LLM backend |
| `ai_horde` | AI Horde image generation |
| `http` | Shared HTTP server with optional SSL |
| `mcp` | MCP JSON-RPC protocol |
| `tunnel` | Tunnel manager (ngrok, cloudflare, bore, tailscale) |

## Development

```bash
./install.sh              # Set up dev environment
make deploy               # Build + install + restart LO + show log
make test                 # Run tests
```
